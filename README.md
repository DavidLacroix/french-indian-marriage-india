# Guide to register a a marriage between a French and Indian citizen in India

## First things first
This guide is meant to be of some help for couples that wish to marry in India. It is specially aimed at French/India couples though the procedure should be pretty similar for any other other nationality wishing to marry an Indian in India. It is done without pretension and cannot be considered as authority on the matter, this is the procedure we followed, it might contains inaccuracies. The guide is written from an experience in registering a special marriage in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India around December 2015. Law, regulations and procedures will change over time, for this guide to be of any help prior to 2016, **please correct and improve it**. It can be quickly and easily done by creating a github account and editing the readme.md file.

## Overall of the key documents you will need throughout
Those documents will be necessary at different stages of the procedure. It is best to get them in advance as some of them might require some time to get. Keep multiples photocopies of those documents with you through the many office you will visit, it will save you some time running back and forth.

**Each side need those documents**
* ID proof
  * passport
  * **or** voter id and aadhaar card
* Address proof
  * ration card at your name
  * **or**  rental agreement and any of one household bill (electricity, phone, gaz ...)
  * **or** letter from the landlord and id proof of the landlord (and address proof of the landlord)
* ID photos
  * a bunch of recent passport size photography
* Birth certificate
  * recent (less than 3 months old) official birth certificate copy (the copy is delivered by your government)
* Filiation
  * marriage certificate of the parents
  * **or** family official document (ration card/livret de famille)
  * **or** affidavit mentioning the filiation (avoid that unless last resort)

## Overall procedure
* Declare your will to get married in the Indian government office.
* Declare your will to get married in the Consulate with proof that it was already initiated in the Indian office
* Once both clearance period (bans) are completed, get married in the Indian office
* Send your marriage certificate to the Consulate for the marriage to be effective in the other administration

Indian bans period: roughly ***1 month**
French bans period: **7 days** to **1 month**

## Local registrar office - notice of intended marriage
The place you will start the procedure is the local registrar office (sub registrar office). The local registrar office will accept procedures only if you live within its vicinity. Choose whichever depending on what address proof you have. Search online for the closest subregistrar and confirm with them if your address is under their jurisdiction.
The sub registrar office will help you to declare your intention of getting married. The document you will have to submit:

** Ultimately the following might change from office to office, state to state. the registrar office will guide you and provide you the necessary forms.**
* [Notice of intended marriage](notice_intended_marriage.pdf)
* [Third schedule] (third_schedule.pdf)
* Id proof photocopy (original to be shown)
* Address proof
* 2-3 id photos

Don't forget to get a receipt for your application. You will need it when coming back later on and it will help you to initiate the procedure with the consulate.

## Consulate - non objection certificate
I cannot speak for other consulate but the french consulate of Pondicherry was transparent and effective. You can contact them by mail (or phone) through the *service de l'etat civil*. Here is the document they publish to assist the production of a non objection certificate: [demande de certificat de capacite a mariage](demande_certificat_capacite_marriage.doc). You will have to schedule an appointment to submit your completed folder. You might be asked for a separate interview, both member of the couple must go together to the appointment. All the procedure with the consulate will be simplified (including the bans period) if you are registered (registre des francais etablis a l'etranger).
### About the documents to submit
Any document that is not written in French has to be translated. It can be done by yourself on paper with a pen. There is no need to go through an expensive translator. 
The consulate will not accept the Indian birth certificate as it is. It has to be stamped with an Apostille before being eligible. To be apostilled a document must be authenticated, to be authenticated a document must be reviewed by a lawyer (or any personnel with sufficient law credientials).

**[Official reference for the apostille](http://mea.gov.in/apostille.htm)**
#### Notarize the document
Any lawyer office can verify and apply a stamp on a document. It is fast and easy. It shouldn't be pricy.

#### Attestation/Authentication
Once notarized, the document can be certified by the court. Find the list of offices that offer authentication in the link above. As usual you will need (at least...):
* ID proof photocopies (visa copy if applies)
* Notarized original copy of the birth certificate
* 2 photocopies of the birth certificate

It is free but might take more than a day depending on which state/district is issuying the birth certificate.

#### Apostille
You will have to find the closest Ministry of External Affairs office. You will need (at least):
* ID proof photocopies (visa copy if applies)
* Authenticated notarized original copy of the birth certificate
* 2-3 photocopies of the birth certificate
* a 50/- INR  postal order (check)

Some companies offer to apostille your document for a cost [VFS attestation](http://www.vfsattestation.com/). It seems everything had to be done through the office in Delhi. In the end it seemed easier and much cheaper to do every thing myself (I don't regret that now, the whole procedure is time consuming though).

## Local registrar office - civil marriage
Once the period (around 1 month) of Indian bans is completed and you are in possession of your non objection certificate, simply go to the sub registrar office, the special marriage will be celebrated (it'll take 1-2 hours). Here is the document and forms that were required from us:
* [form1](form1.jpg)
* [form2](form2.jpg)
* [form3](form3.jpg)
* Eventually some ID proof, pictures...

They will deliver you a marriage certificate a couple of days after.

## Consulate - marriage certificate transcription
If you have requested the non objection certificate in advance, almost nothing is left to do. Just send the original marriage certificate and the consulate will record it in the french books and deliver you a French family book.
